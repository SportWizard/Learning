# What is dot product?
Dot product is a concept in [[Linear Algebra]]. It tell us the how two vectors similar in term of direction

# Dot product outputs
Positive value (angle < $90\degree$): Two vectors points in similar direction (not exact similar, but somewhat in the same direction)
Zero (angle = $90\degree$): Two vectors are orthogonal to each other
Negative value (angle > $90\degree$): Two vector's direction are opposite to each other

# Equation
$$
\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} = ||\vec{v}|| \; ||\vec{u}|| \; \cos \theta
$$
$\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
$\vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
