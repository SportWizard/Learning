# What is limit?
Limit is a mathematical concept in [[Calculus]] that describes the value a function, $f(x)$ approaches as n get infinitely close to the point n. The limit may exist even if $f(x)$ is not defined at n, and it only exists if the function approaches the same value from all direction

# Equation
$$
\lim_{x \to n} f(x)
