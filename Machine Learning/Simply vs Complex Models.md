# What is simply vs complex models?
Simply and complex models are concepts in [[Machine Learning]]. It describe the complexity of the model

# Simple models
- Requires less training data
- Captures less information
- Less free parameters (a.k.a adjustable weights)
- Could lead to under-fitting
- e.g. Linear model (line or hyperplane): $y = a_0 + a_1 x$, where $a_0$ and $a_1$ are free parameters

# Complex models
- Require more training data
- Captures more information with more precision
- More free parameters (a.k.a adjustable weights)
- Could lead to over-fitting
- e.g. Polynomial (non-linear): $y = a_0 x + a_1 x^2 + a_1 x^3 + \dots$
